title: Chinatown Connects
---

We understand that this issue is bigger than Chinatown.

This project aims to be in conversation with the issues of equity, affordability, and cultural erasure in Chinatowns across the continent and also to neighborhoods across Washington, D.C., particularly in Black and Brown neighborhoods that are bearing a disproppropotionate burden from both displacement, poverty concentration and erasure as a result of gentrification across the District.

D.C.'s Chinatown’s both visibility and invisibility makes for a unique case study. Its relatively small footprint within the city’s center has transformed dramatically over the past forty years. Furthermore, D.C.’s Chinatown rarely makes it into the public dialogue amongst larger, and more well-known Chinatowns across the continent, despite being marked by similar patterns of gentrification and erasure, albeit at a smaller scale in comparison to San Francisco, New York City, or Boston.
